Visited website, and the ( GitHub clickable link) Takes you to github.com/poeapp/poeapp , when its supposed to be
just github.com/poeapp

https://github.com/poeapp/poeapp/
vs
https://github.com/poeapp

Also A lot of players have been Spamming me in-game to buy 100x of a Prophecy
That i only have like 1 or 2,3,4 of ect.
The reason is because when you go to search example
fire from the sky prophecy
it says Fixed rate 100 @ 300 chaos
when in reality that player only has 2 @ 3 chaos each.

Hopefully someone can make these quick easy changes.
